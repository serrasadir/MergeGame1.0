Tried to use a hybrid pooling system to get the most efficient results - though have some misused functions that i will never use again i.e get all children functions
Have an inventory function: if you drag a number box (aka appliance)on inventory button, it will be stored till you get it out from the inventory. Click on the inventory button to see the stored appliances.
