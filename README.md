I implemented a hybrid pooling system to maximize performance. Although there are a few leftover functions (such as "get all children") that I no longer use, the core logic remains clean and efficient.
The game includes an inventory feature: when you drag a number box (also known as an appliance) onto the inventory button, it gets stored. You can access stored appliances anytime by clicking the inventory button.
The game also supports autosaving â€” your progress is saved automatically, and you can continue exactly where you left off, even after closing and reopening the game.
